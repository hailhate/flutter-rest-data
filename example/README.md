# Example for flutter_rest_data

## Setup

- A number of dependencies rely on code generation using [build_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner). In order for the project to compile successfully, you must run the build runner tool:

```bash
$ flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
